# AdventOfCode2017

I goal I set to myself to complete before AdventOfCode 2018 is released

Some spaghetti here, some spaghetti there. 

Trying to learn as I go through each puzzle on how to organize my code better. 

Edit: Didn't have the time to complete this before the 2018 calendar came out. It got too complicated at some point, and I just didn't have the time to spare.
